# Video Catalog

This project is a React assessment for a Video Catalog application. Since the provided API returns only one movie, I have implemented a custom JSON server to demonstrate the full range of functionalities.



- **Custom JSON Server:**  
  Uses a self-hosted JSON server located at `src/sample-server/movies.json` to provide a diverse set of movie data.

- Before running the application, ensure to start the json server using the following command:
```bash
json-server --watch src/sample-server/movies.json --port 3004
```
